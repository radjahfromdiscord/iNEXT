# iNEXT

### Dev notes:
iNEXT Contains the current best kill all for Big Paintball, but sometimes the kill all could get you banned. Use alt-accounts. The feature "Turret Trail" is also defined as "Turret Spam" which allows the user to server side spame place turrets. This means that everyone can see.
